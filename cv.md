### About me

Not long ago I got interested in programming. I would find code writing very interesting  to try myself in writing quality code and to apply my knowledge practically.
IT technologies are developing very fast nowadays and itâ€™s not always possible to monitor modern trends, studying only the theory. I know that the Rolling Scopes School gives opportunity to approve yourself. It seems to me that my decades of experience in a team in combination with learned skills will allow me to participate  in the training and in future to make my contribution to the companies development.
