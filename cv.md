### About me

Not long ago I got interested in programming. I would find code writing very interesting  to try myself in writing quality code and to apply my knowledge practically.
IT technologies are developing very fast nowadays and it’s not always possible to monitor modern trends, studying only the theory. I know that the Rolling Scopes School gives opportunity to approve yourself. It seems to me that my decades of experience in a team in combination with learned skills will allow me to participate  in the training and in future to make my contribution to the companies development.
